## The Situation

The BHI program had the technology. Wearables tracked sleep. Apps captured mood. RPM devices monitored vitals.

What they had was data. What they didn't have was **context**.

Every alert was the same: a number outside a threshold. The care team couldn't tell if a patient's sleep disruption was a medication side effect, a life stressor, or a symptom flare. They called everyone — or called no one and hoped the alerts resolved.

The result: alert fatigue for staff, alarm fatigue for patients, and missed opportunities to intervene early.

## The Transformation

HANA sits between the data and the clinical team, adding the one thing raw alerts can't provide: a conversation.

When a wearable flags poor sleep, HANA doesn't just forward the alert. It calls the patient: "I noticed your sleep has been off this week. Can you tell me what's been going on?"

The response — stress at work, medication making them drowsy, nothing in particular — gets routed appropriately. Real clinical issues escalate. Noise gets filtered.

Care teams now see context-rich summaries. They act on patterns, not pings. Patients feel heard between visits.

## Before & After

| Metric | Before | After HANA |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Alert quality | Raw numbers without context | **Contextualized summaries with patient voice** |
| Staff triage | Couldn't triage effectively | **Exception-based workflow** |
| Adherence | 30% baseline | **>70% with active monitoring** |
| Alert volume | Alert fatigue | **60% reduction in low-value alerts** |
| Early warnings | Missed | **Earlier intervention on real issues** |

## Operational & Clinical Value

- **Staff efficiency:** 60% reduction in false-positive alert follow-up
- **Patient engagement:** 85% weekly vs. 15–20% industry benchmark
- **Adherence:** 2.3x improvement (30% → 70%+)
- **Clinical insight:** Barrier data integrated into care plans
