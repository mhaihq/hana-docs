## The Situation

The Friday before a Monday surgery, the pre-op coordinator discovered the patient's cardiac clearance letter was missing. The cardiologist's office was closed. The OR slot — worth $15,000 in facility time — had to be cancelled.

This wasn't rare. It was routine. Staff spent 60% of their time on administrative chase work. Surgeons walked into ORs not knowing if they'd actually operate. Patients who'd prepared emotionally, logistically, and financially were told to go home.

## The Transformation

HANA took over pre-op orchestration with a simple premise: start with what's already in the chart, then fill only the gaps.

The system pulls existing documentation, identifies what's missing per procedure type, and runs adaptive outreach through whatever channel works for that patient. Coordinators now manage by exception. Surgeons get pre-op packets 72 hours out — complete.

## Before & After

| Metric | Before | After HANA |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Documentation gathering time | 4.2 days | **1.1 days** |
| Cases requiring staff phone chase | 42% | **8%** |
| Same-week cancellation rate | 8–12% | **< 3%** |
| Staff time allocation | 60% admin | **Clinical exceptions only** |
| Pre-op packet timing | Day-before | **72 hours out** |

## Financial Impact

- **Avoided cancellation costs:** ~$15K per OR slot × 85% reduction in cancellations
- **Staff productivity:** 2.1 FTE equivalent time recovered annually
- **Surgeon satisfaction:** Zero day-before documentation surprises in pilot
