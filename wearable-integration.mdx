# Wearable Device Integration

## The Problem

Remote monitoring devices generate vast amounts of physiological data — but data without context is noise. When a wearable flags poor sleep, the care team can't tell if it's a medication side effect, a life stressor, or a symptom flare. Every alert looks the same: a number outside a threshold.

The result: alert fatigue for staff, alarm fatigue for patients, and missed opportunities to intervene early.

## How HANA Solves It

HANA acts as an **engagement layer** between wearable devices and clinical teams, adding the crucial context that raw alerts can't provide.

When a wearable flags an anomaly, HANA doesn't just forward the alert. It calls the patient:

> "I noticed your sleep has been off this week. Can you tell me what's been going on?"

The response — stress at work, medication making them drowsy, nothing in particular — gets routed appropriately. Real clinical issues escalate. Noise gets filtered.

    Proactive calls to establish a health baseline, detecting subtle changes in wellbeing, mood, or physical function that sensor data alone might miss.

## Proven Results

| Metric | Before HANA | After HANA |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Alert context | Raw numbers without explanation | **Contextualized summaries with patient voice** |
| Staff triage ability | Couldn't differentiate real vs. false alerts | **Exception-based workflow** |
| Baseline adherence | 30% | **>70%** |
| Low-value alert volume | High (alert fatigue) | **60% reduction** |
| Early warning detection | Missed | **Proactive intervention on real issues** |

## 30-Day Pilot Programme

HANA offers a structured 30-day pilot for wearable integration, designed as a low-risk, high-impact initiative to validate the engagement layer approach.
