# Platform Partnerships (HANA Connect)

## The Problem

Digital health platforms invest millions in building great products — but after week one, engagement craters. Patients open the app once, maybe twice, then forget about it. Push notifications get ignored. Gamification feels gimmicky. More features create bloat.

The insight: the best outcomes come from patients who talk to care navigators. But you can't afford to call everyone.

## How HANA Connect Solves It

Rather than rebuilding your product, integrate HANA as an engagement layer via SDK.

HANA handles the conversations your app can't have:
- Proactive check-ins between app sessions
- Symptom collection and adherence follow-up
- Escalation to human navigators when needed
- Continuous clinical data flow back into your platform

You keep your UX. Your clinical team keeps their workflows. HANA makes sure patients stay engaged between the moments they open your app.
