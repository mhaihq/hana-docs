# Chronic Care Management

## The Problem

Value-based care programs (CCM, BHI, PCM, APCM) represent significant revenue opportunities for clinics — Medicare and Medicaid pay between $60 and $150 per patient per month. But enrolling patients is costly, onboarding them is labor-intensive, and maintaining the required weekly touchpoints to update care plans is unsustainable with manual phone calls.

Most clinics leave money on the table because they lack the bandwidth to enroll, engage, and document at scale.

## How HANA Solves It

HANA empowers clinics to adopt reimbursable care programs by automating the patient touchpoints required for compliance:

- **Enrollment outreach** — identify eligible patients and guide them through program enrollment
- **Weekly/bi-weekly check-ins** — maintain the required contact frequency through conversational AI
- **Care plan updates** — gather the clinical data needed to update care plans and document compliance
- **Structured documentation** — write back to the EHR in the format required for reimbursement

## The Revenue Opportunity

| Program | Monthly Reimbursement | Required Touchpoints | HANA's Role |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **CCM** | $60–$80/patient/month | 20+ min/month of care management | Automated check-ins, barrier identification, care plan data |
| **BHI** | $50–$70/patient/month | Monthly behavioral health assessment | Conversational PHQ-9/GAD-7, adherence monitoring |
| **PCM** | $70–$100/patient/month | Monthly care management for serious conditions | Condition-specific monitoring, medication adherence |
| **APCM** | $100–$150/patient/month | Continuous chronic care management | Comprehensive longitudinal engagement |

HANA turns these programs from a staffing challenge into a technology-powered revenue stream — adding top-line revenue while simultaneously improving patient outcomes.

## Proven Results

| Metric | Before HANA | After HANA |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Weekly patient engagement | 15–20% | **85%** |
| Medication adherence | 30% | **73%** |
| Denial rate | 15–20% | **3.2%** |
| Alert fatigue reduction | — | **60%** |
