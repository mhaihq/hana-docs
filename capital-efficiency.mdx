# Capital Efficiency

HANA has achieved outsized traction relative to capital deployed — a key indicator of strong product-market fit, founder execution, and genuine customer demand.

## Efficiency Comparison

| Company | Capital Raised | Traction | Efficiency |
|---------|---------------|----------|------------|
| **HANA** | **$100K** | **1M+ conversations, 3K patients, 2 gov contracts** | **10,000 conv/$1K** |
| Hello Patient | $28.8M | Unknown conversations, strong US traction | Unknown |
| Attuned | $13M | 1 disclosed customer | Low |
| VoiceCare AI | $4.54M | 1 pilot (Mayo Clinic) | Low |
| Prosper AI | $6.6M | 15 customers | Medium |
| Honey Health | $7.8M | 100+ customers (back-office, not patient-facing) | High |

## What This Proves

1. **Strong product-market fit** — Clinics adopt and pay for HANA because it solves real problems, not because of heavy sales spend
2. **Founder execution** — The team has built a production-grade platform and closed pilots across 5 countries on minimal capital
3. **Real customer demand** — The pipeline is not manufactured; HANA is supply-constrained (limited engineering capacity), not demand-constrained

## Go-to-Market Efficiency

| Dimension | Typical Competitor | HANA |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| **Market Approach** | Direct sales to end customers | API-first (platforms integrate us) |
| **Geographic Focus** | US-only | Multi-country (5 countries) |
| **Language Support** | English-only | Multi-language (3+) |
| **Sales Motion** | Replace existing workflow | Augment existing care model |
| **Integration Time** | 3–6 months | 2–4 weeks (modern EHRs) |
| **Pricing Model** | Per-seat or subscription | Usage-based, PMPM |
| **Network Effects** | Low (each sale independent) | High (platforms create flywheel) |

## Strategic Advantage

Infrastructure positioning + network effects = winner-take-most dynamics.

When platforms integrate HANA, their customers become HANA's users. Each integration expands the data flywheel and reduces future customer acquisition cost — a fundamentally different growth model than direct sales alone.
