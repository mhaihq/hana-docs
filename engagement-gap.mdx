# The 10,000 Hour Problem

Healthcare is designed for brief, episodic interactions — the 15-minute doctor's appointment. Yet a patient's health is a continuous reality, managed over the thousands of hours of daily life that follow.

This creates a fundamental vulnerability in the care journey:

<Note>
  **The Engagement Gap** is the vast, unmonitored period between appointments where patient health is managed alone — a silence that often leads to deterioration, missed warning signs, and costly, preventable crises.

## What Happens in the Gap

During this unmonitored time, patients are left on their own to navigate complex health decisions. These challenges occur "in the dark," invisible to the clinical team until the next appointment — or until a crisis occurs.

- **Medication Adherence** — Is the patient actually taking their medication as prescribed? For many, the answer is no. An estimated 50% of patients with chronic conditions do not take medications as prescribed.
- **Clarity of Next Steps** — Does the patient fully understand what they need to do after their visit? Confusion about follow-up actions is common.
- **Unreported Side Effects** — Without a channel for communication, side effects go unreported and unmanaged.
- **Lost Connection** — When patients feel disconnected from their provider, they are less likely to stay on track with their care plan.

## Why Traditional Tools Have Failed

For years, healthcare has attempted to bridge this gap with digital tools. These attempts have largely failed for one fundamental reason: **they placed the burden of engagement on the least able person — the patient.**

| Solution | The Promise | The Reality |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Patient Portals** | "Patients will check in" | **15% open rates.** Patients forget passwords. |
| **Health Apps** | "Digital therapeutics" | **90% abandonment.** App fatigue leads to deletion. |
| **RPM Devices** | "Continuous monitoring" | **Sit in junk drawers.** Require behavior change. |

The common thread is **friction**. Every failed tool required patients to:
- Download an app
- Create a login and password
- Remember to enter data
- Make a conscious behavior change

Each step is another burden on someone already managing the physical and cognitive load of their illness.

  **If it requires a download, a login, or a behavior change — it's already dead.**
</Warning>

From the provider side, the challenge is just as significant. Most clinicians want to maintain a connection with their patients between visits, but they simply lack the capacity. For every one hour of direct patient care, clinicians spend nearly two hours on EHR and administrative work.

## The Cost of Silence

The Engagement Gap creates measurable negative impacts for every stakeholder in the healthcare ecosystem.

### Financial Impact

The gap is directly linked to **$150 billion** in annual losses in the U.S. healthcare system alone, driven by:

| Driver | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Medication non-adherence | 50% of chronic patients don't take meds as prescribed |
| Missed appointments | 23% of patients miss crucial follow-ups |
| Preventable emergencies | Patients return only when conditions escalate to crisis |

### Provider Burden

- **Administrative overload** — For every 1 hour of patient care, clinicians spend ~2 hours on EHR and desk work.
- **Alert fatigue** — RPM devices generate high volumes of alerts that lack the crucial "why" behind the data, forcing staff to investigate false alarms or ignore everything.

### Patient and Family Impact

Patients feel the burden of managing their health alone between visits. Families are often only alerted to a problem when it has already become an emergency. This communication failure erodes trust and drives attrition to providers who offer a more transparent, communicative relationship.

## The Opportunity

Bridging this gap — transforming healthcare from a series of disconnected episodes into a continuous, supportive system — is one of the most significant challenges and profound opportunities in modern healthcare.

The solution isn't to ask patients to do more. It's to meet them where they already are — on the phone — and have a conversation.
