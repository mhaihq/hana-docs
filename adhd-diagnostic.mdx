## The Situation

The intake coordinator was drowning. Every ADHD evaluation required chasing down three separate people — patient, caregiver, teacher or employer — across four different systems. Forms sat incomplete for days. Patients showed up to first appointments with clinicians who had no context. Staff spent 4+ hours per case just assembling the basics.

The real cost wasn't just time. It was the cascade effect: rushed first appointments, incomplete assessments, delayed diagnoses, and patients who gave up waiting.

## The Transformation

HANA replaced the entire intake workflow — not with another portal patients ignore, but with a voice-first system that calls patients directly. No app. No login. Just a conversation.

The system reads existing chart data first, so patients aren't asked what the clinic already knows. It orchestrates outreach across all collateral sources — patient, caregiver, school — and routes each to the right channel (voice for detailed history, SMS for quick confirmations).

By the time a clinician opens the chart, they have a structured pre-assessment summary with clinical-grade documentation ready for the first visit.

## Before & After

| Metric | Before | After HANA |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Intake completion rate | 64.5% | **96.2%** |
| Patient drop-off before first visit | 35.5% | **3.8%** |
| Average response time | 4.2 days | **1.1 days** |
| Cases needing manual follow-up | 42% | **8%** |
| Average words per intake variable | 12 | **145** |

## ROI Breakdown

- **Staff time recovered:** 3.5 hours per intake × 500 cases = 1,750 hours/year
- **Patient retention improvement:** 31.7 percentage points (35.5% → 3.8% drop-off)
- **Clinician report preference:** 78% rated HANA summaries as more clinically useful
- **SDOH capture:** 340% more social determinants documented vs. static forms
