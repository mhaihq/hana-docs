# The Operating System for Continuous Care

Healthcare is designed for brief, episodic interactions — the 15-minute doctor's appointment. Yet a patient's health is a continuous reality, managed over the thousands of hours that follow. This creates a fundamental disconnect: our healthcare system works for the visit, but it fails during the 10,000 hours that come after.

**HANA bridges that gap.**

HANA is a conversational AI infrastructure platform that proactively engages patients through familiar channels — voice calls, SMS, and WhatsApp — requiring no app downloads, logins, or behavior changes. The platform reads from the EHR, engages the patient with personalized conversations, and writes structured clinical notes back, creating a closed-loop system.

## What Makes HANA Different

HANA is not another patient portal, health app, or reminder system. It is **engagement infrastructure** — a reasoning engine that learns how each patient prefers to communicate, adapts over time, and delivers clinical protocols at the right moment through the right channel.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Zero Patient Friction">
    No app download. No login. No new hardware. Patients simply answer a phone call or reply to a text message. If it requires a download, a login, or a behavior change — it's already dead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deep Workflow Integration">
    HANA is not an app on top of the EHR. Bidirectional read/write-back capability makes it a core part of the clinical workflow, leading to high switching costs once embedded.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adaptive Reasoning">
    The engine is trained on over 1 million patient interactions across multiple languages. It learns interaction patterns, cultural context, and communication preferences for each patient over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clinical Safety by Design">
    Built with healthcare-grade safety guardrails, dedicated risk monitoring, and human-in-the-loop escalation protocols. Over 1 million interactions with zero critical adverse events.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingest">
    HANA reads the patient's chart and clinical context directly from the EHR. No redundant questions — the system knows what the clinic already knows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reason">
    The adaptive reasoning engine analyzes existing data to determine the right question, the right channel (voice, SMS, WhatsApp), and the right time for engagement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engage">
    A conversational agent interacts with the patient through natural dialogue, gathering rich narrative context that static forms and checkboxes miss.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write-Back">
    The system structures the conversation into a clinical note and writes it back to the EHR — closing the loop and giving clinicians synthesized, actionable intelligence.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Aggregate Outcomes

| Metric | HANA Performance | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|

## Deployment Model

HANA operates like **Stripe for healthcare engagement**: plug directly into a clinic (Stripe Checkout), or let platforms build on top of HANA's infrastructure (Stripe Connect).
