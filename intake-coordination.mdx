# Intake & Coordination

## The Problem

Clinical intake is the bottleneck where care begins — and often where patients are lost. Traditional intake requires chasing down multiple parties (patient, caregiver, school, employer) across multiple systems, with forms that sit incomplete for days. Staff spend hours per case assembling the basics, patients show up to first appointments with clinicians who have no context, and 35% of patients drop off before they're ever seen.

## How HANA Solves It

HANA replaces the entire intake workflow with a voice-first system that calls patients directly. No app. No login. Just a conversation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read Existing Data">
    HANA pulls from the EHR first, so patients aren't asked what the clinic already knows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Orchestrate Outreach">
    The system coordinates across all collateral sources — patient, caregiver, school — routing each to the right channel (voice for detailed history, SMS for quick confirmations).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Narrative Context">
    Conversational intake captures rich qualitative data that static checkboxes miss — social determinants, barriers, nuances of the patient's situation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deliver Pre-Assessment">
    By the time a clinician opens the chart, they have a structured pre-assessment summary with clinical-grade documentation ready for the first visit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

- **ADHD diagnostic intake** — orchestrate patient, caregiver, and teacher/employer questionnaires
- **Psychiatric intake** — capture presenting concerns, risk factors, treatment preferences through adaptive dialogue
- **Primary care onboarding** — collect family history, functional area check-ins, and social health factors
- **Waitlist management** — keep patients engaged and data current during long wait periods
