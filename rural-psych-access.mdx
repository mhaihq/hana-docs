## The Situation

The clinic's patient portal had every feature: secure messaging, intake forms, appointment scheduling, document upload. It also had a **23% adoption rate**.

For 77% of patients — many in rural areas with limited broadband, many older, many without smartphones — the "digital front door" was a locked door.

Wait times for first appointments stretched to 6+ weeks. Patients who needed help most were dropping off before they ever saw a provider.

## The Transformation

HANA met patients where they were: on the phone.

Voice-first intake means patients don't need broadband, don't need a smartphone, don't need to create an account. They answer a call and have a conversation.

The system captures detailed clinical history — presenting concerns, risk factors, treatment preferences, logistics — through adaptive dialogue. It handles complex branching (depression screening triggers different follow-up than anxiety) without requiring patients to navigate a form.

The output is a structured pre-assessment that supports therapist matching. Patients are routed to the right provider faster.

## Before & After

| Metric | Before | After HANA |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Portal adoption rate | 23% | **100% accessibility** (phone-based) |
| Wait to first appointment | 6+ weeks | **Faster time-to-first-appointment** |
| Pre-visit drop-off | High | **82% reduction** |
| Intake data quality | Incomplete for matching | **Rich narrative data for provider matching** |
| Access equity | Excluded patients without broadband | **Equitable access across demographics** |

## Access & Equity Impact

- **Population reached:** 77% of patients previously excluded from digital intake
- **Clinical utility:** Blinded reviewers preferred HANA intakes 78% of the time
- **Matching accuracy:** Reduced provider-patient mismatch by improving intake detail
- **Health equity:** Voice-only option enables access for underserved populations
