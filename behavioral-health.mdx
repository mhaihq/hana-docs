# Behavioral Health

## The Problem

Behavioral health faces a unique engagement challenge: the therapeutic relationship is the treatment. Between sessions, patients are managing conditions alone — with no structured support, no accountability, and no data flowing back to their care team. Wait times stretch to 6+ weeks. Patients drop off before they're ever seen. And clinicians walk into sessions with no visibility into what happened since the last visit.

## How HANA Solves It

HANA maintains the therapeutic connection between sessions through regular, adaptive conversations that:

- **Screen for risk** — PHQ-9, GAD-7, and custom assessments delivered conversationally, not as static forms
- **Monitor symptom trends** — track mood, sleep, anxiety, and functional status over time
- **Support medication adherence** — identify barriers (cost, side effects, misunderstanding) through open-ended dialogue
- **Capture social determinants** — housing instability, loneliness, substance use, and other SDOH factors that surface in conversation but rarely in checkboxes
- **Enable therapist matching** — voice-first intake captures rich narrative data that supports matching patients to the right provider

## Multi-Country Deployment

HANA's behavioral health solution is validated across diverse clinical settings:

| Setting | Location | Primary Indication | Patients |
|---------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Specialized Mood Disorder Network | North America | Bipolar spectrum & mood disorders | 415 |
| Public Health Waitlist Management | Western Europe | GAD, MDD, adjustment disorders | 214 |
| Trauma Response Initiative | Eastern Europe | PTSD & acute stress reactions | 198 |
| Geriatric Community Care | Western Europe | Depression & social isolation | 185 |

The product is the same. The clinical protocols are the same. Only the incentive structure changes by geography.

## Proven Results

| Metric | Before HANA | After HANA |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Pre-diagnostic time | 4+ hours | **Under 40 minutes** (-85%) |
| Intake completion | 64.5% | **96.2%** |
| Pre-visit drop-off | 35.5% | **3.8%** |
| SDOH markers captured | 0.4/patient | **3.2/patient** |
| Clinician preference for HANA reports | — | **93%** |

## Voice-First Access for Underserved Populations

Many behavioral health patients — particularly in rural areas, older populations, and those without reliable broadband — are excluded by digital-first tools. HANA's voice-first approach means:

- No broadband required
- No smartphone required
- No account creation required
- 100% accessibility through standard phone service
