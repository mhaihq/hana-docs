# The Reasoning Engine

HANA's core differentiator is not voice quality or chatbot capability — it's the **reasoning engine** that sits behind every patient interaction. While competitors build voice AI for transactions (booking, routing, FAQs), HANA builds engagement infrastructure for **relationships** — continuous care that adapts over time.

## Why Reasoning Matters

Consider the difference between a reminder and a conversation:

| Approach | Example | Outcome |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Generic reminder** | "Did you take your medication? Y/N" | Patient ignores it (like every other automated message) |
| **Contextual conversation** | "Last time we spoke, you mentioned the new medication was making you drowsy. How has that been this week?" | Patient engages — because the question is relevant, personal, and shows continuity |

The reasoning engine makes the second approach possible at scale.

## How It Works

### Pre-Call Reasoning

Before each patient interaction, the reasoning engine performs a multi-step analysis:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Integration">
    Pull all available data: EHR chart, past HANA conversations, wearable data, lab results, medication list, and any outstanding tasks or flags.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gap Analysis">
    Identify what information is missing, outdated, or needs follow-up. The Data Science Agent ensures no redundant questions are asked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Matching">
    Match the patient's current status to the clinic's defined clinical protocols. Determine which assessments, check-ins, or follow-ups are due.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personalization">
    Factor in the patient's communication preferences: Do they respond better to voice or text? What time of day? How complex should the language be? What's their cultural context?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Question Generation">
    Produce a prioritized set of questions and conversation objectives, then hand them to the conversational agent for delivery.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adaptive Engagement Logic

The reasoning engine continuously adapts based on patient behavior:

**Frequency adaptation** — If a patient is consistently adherent, the system may reduce check-in frequency. If adherence drops, frequency increases automatically.

**Channel optimization** — The engine learns which channel works best for each patient. Some patients respond to voice; others prefer SMS. Some prefer morning; others evening.

**Complexity calibration** — Language complexity adjusts based on the patient's demonstrated comprehension level and communication style.

**Escalation intelligence** — The engine recognizes patterns that warrant clinical intervention and routes appropriately based on the clinic's defined escalation protocols.

## Memory Layer

HANA maintains a persistent **memory layer** for each patient that grows over time:

| Memory Type | What It Captures |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Interaction History** | Every conversation, response, and outcome |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | Preferred channels, response times, engagement trends |
| **Clinical Context** | Reported symptoms, barriers, side effects, social determinants |
| **Relationship State** | Trust level, engagement trajectory, communication preferences |

This memory creates continuity between interactions — something no static form or one-off reminder can achieve.

<Note>
  This is analogous to how a human clinician builds rapport: you know that your grandfather needs a phone call (he won't read a text), but your 14-year-old daughter needs a text first (she'll never answer a call). HANA learns these patterns for every patient.
</Note>

## Clinical Protocol Execution

Clinics have spent years building clinical protocols that work. The problem isn't the protocols — it's delivering them consistently at scale.

HANA's reasoning engine takes existing protocols (provided as PDFs, documents, or structured knowledge bases) and delivers them through conversation:

- **Standardized assessments** (PHQ-9, GAD-7, DIVA for ADHD) delivered conversationally rather than as static forms
- **Care pathway management** following clinic-defined branching logic
- **Medication monitoring** with adaptive follow-up based on reported adherence
- **Risk screening** with real-time escalation to clinical staff

The protocols don't change. The delivery mechanism does — from paper forms and manual phone calls to intelligent, adaptive conversations.

## Comparison to Generic AI

| Dimension | Generic LLM / Voice Agent | HANA Reasoning Engine |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Conversation logic** | Generic prompting | Pre-computed reasoning based on full patient context |
| **Adaptation** | Static protocol | Learns patient preferences over time |
| **Clinical knowledge** | General medical training data | 1M+ proprietary patient interaction dataset |
| **Latency optimization** | Real-time processing only | Pre-processing separates reasoning from delivery |
| **Safety** | Prompt-based guardrails | Dedicated safety classifiers + clinic-defined escalation |
| **Memory** | Conversation-level context | Persistent, longitudinal patient memory |

<Info>
  The reasoning engine is what makes HANA infrastructure rather than an application. Applications do one thing. Infrastructure powers whatever the clinic needs.
