# Methodology

## Study Classification

This work constitutes a **quality improvement (QI) analysis** of operational data collected during routine clinical onboarding:

- **Retrospective design** — data analyzed after collection during standard workflows
- **Non-randomized** — all patients experienced both phases sequentially
- **Internal evaluation** — analysis conducted by the implementing organization

## Evaluation Phases

### Phase 1: Baseline Static Data Collection

Patients received a comprehensive digital intake form through the EHR system (PracticeQ) with standardized automated reminders.

**Data captured:** Time spent on intake, completion rates, drop-off points.

### Phase 2: Dynamic Multi-Agent Conversational Intake (HANA)

Approximately one week after Phase 1, patients transitioned to HANA's omnichannel conversational system (SMS, WhatsApp, voice-AI).

The multi-agent architecture:
- **Data Science Agent** analyzes Phase 1 intake to identify missing data
- **Health Coach Agent** uses DS Agent outputs to guide conversation while minimizing redundancy
- **Reasoning Engine** determines contextually relevant follow-up prompts

## Cohort Selection

**N = 1,012 patients** from four clinical sites selected to represent diverse healthcare delivery models:

| Region | Setting | n | Primary Indication |
|--------|---------|---|-------------------|
| North America | Private Outpatient Network | 415 | Bipolar Spectrum & Mood Disorders |
| Western Europe | Public Health Service | 214 | GAD, MDD, Adjustment Disorders |
| Eastern Europe | NGO/Humanitarian Aid | 198 | PTSD & Acute Stress Reactions |
| Western Europe | Geriatric Community Care | 185 | Depression & Social Isolation |

Of 1,150 patients initially invited, 1,012 (88%) completed the process and met inclusion criteria.

## Clinical Implementation Contexts

Sites were selected to stress-test the system across:

- **Specialized Mood Disorder Network (North America):** Complex, episode-specific longitudinal data capture
- **Trauma Response Initiative (Eastern Europe):** Sensitive history-gathering under conditions of high user distress
- **Geriatric Community Care (Western Europe):** Interface accessibility and digital literacy among non-native digital users (age 65+)
- **Public Health Waitlist Management (Western Europe):** Scalability and throughput for common presentations

## Clinical Expert Panel

Validation by 20 credentialed clinicians (psychiatrists and licensed psychologists):

| Panel | n | Focus |
|-------|---|-------|
| Mood Specialist | 8 | Complex mood disorder intakes |
| Geriatric Specialist | 6 | Cognitive and emotional needs of older adults |
| Trauma-Informed | 6 | Acute stress and PTSD responses |

## Evaluation Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- Interaction counts (turn-based engagement depth)
- Attrition/abandonment rate comparison
- Response latency (time from contact to completion)

### Information Quality
- Data completeness (% of required clinical data points captured)
- Narrative richness (word count and entity extraction rates)
- Gap resolution (Phase 1 gaps addressed in Phase 2)

### Clinical Review
- **Comprehensiveness** — coverage of clinical, social, and lifestyle factors
- **Clinical significance** — identification of clinically meaningful information
- **Perceived usefulness** — 1–5 Likert scale for pre-session preparation utility

## Data Governance

- **Data sovereignty:** Region-locked cloud infrastructure; no cross-border transfer
- **De-identification:** Cryptographic hashing prior to analysis
- **Consent:** Standard service-level agreements and general consent for care coordination
- **Encryption:** End-to-end encrypted messaging channels and HIPAA-compliant SMS gateways
- **Risk management:** NLP classifiers monitoring for acute risk with immediate fail-safe protocols

## Acknowledged Limitations

- Non-blinded evaluation design (reviewers aware of study objectives)
- Reviewers not independent of clinical sites
- Sequential design prevents causal attribution
- Internal analysis by implementing organization
- Exclusion of patients without smartphone access
