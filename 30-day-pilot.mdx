# 30-Day Pilot Programme

The 30-day pilot is a low-risk, high-impact initiative designed to validate HANA's ability to close the engagement gap. It generates proven, quantifiable results that provide a clear business case for broader deployment.

## Pilot Parameters

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Duration** | 30 days (active), with 2–3 weeks pre-launch setup |
| **Cohort size** | 50–100 patients |
| **Channels** | Voice, SMS, WhatsApp (configurable) |
| **Integration** | API connection to existing systems |
| **Reporting** | Weekly KPI dashboards + bi-weekly steering committee |

## Success Criteria

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Weekly patient engagement rate | **85%** (vs. 15–20% industry standard) |
| Medication/device adherence improvement | **30% → 70%+** |
| Reduction in manual clinical follow-up | **Significant reduction from baseline** |
| Clinician and family satisfaction | **Positive feedback on report utility and communication** |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Scoping (2 weeks, pre-launch)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stakeholder Workshops">
    Collaborative sessions with clinical and operational leaders to map the current patient journey, identify challenges, and define the most impactful opportunities for AI-driven intervention.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Definition">
    Jointly define care protocols and conversation flows — including use cases like daily wellness checks, device compliance reminders, and post-alert follow-ups.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Flow Mapping">
    Specify bidirectional data exchange: what flows from your system to HANA (patient roster, device alerts, protocols) and what HANA sends back (call outcomes, summaries, risk alerts, metrics).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalation Pathways">
    Design and confirm bidirectional escalation procedures. Define how concerns detected during conversations trigger clinical alerts within your existing coordination platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Baseline Measurement">
    Establish baseline metrics for key KPIs (device compliance, engagement rates, satisfaction scores) to enable accurate post-pilot comparison.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing (2–3 weeks, pre-launch)

<Steps>
  <Step title="API Connection">
    HANA's engineering team connects to your system via secure API, enabling automated bidirectional data flow as mapped during discovery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conversation Flow Configuration">
    Clinical protocols are configured in HANA's adaptive AI engine, including triggers for contextual calls based on specific events (e.g., elevated heart rate alerts).
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Acceptance Testing">
    Your clinical team validates the end-to-end workflow — data security, call quality, AI summary accuracy, and escalation reliability — before any patient is contacted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Security Validation">
    All integration points validated for HIPAA/GDPR compliance. AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit. BAA executed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Pilot Launch & Execution (30 days)

**Patient enrollment** is frictionless — no app downloads, logins, or behavior changes. Communication via familiar channels (voice calls and SMS).

Core engagement workflows deployed during the pilot:

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Scheduled Wellness Checks** | Establish health baseline, detect subtle changes in wellbeing |
| **Device Compliance Prompts** | Conversational reminders for consistent device usage |
| **Post-Alert Contextual Follow-Up** | API-triggered calls gathering context on device alerts |
| **Medication Adherence Reminders** | Proactive adherence monitoring with side effect detection |

### Phase 4: Measurement & Evaluation (continuous)

Performance tracked across four categories:

| Category | KPIs |
|----------|------|
| **Patient Engagement** | Contact rate, weekly engagement %, response time |
| **Clinical & Adherence** | Device compliance, medication adherence, false positive reduction |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Reduction in manual follow-up, intake time reduction |
| **Satisfaction & ROI** | Family satisfaction, clinician preference, ROI benchmarked against proven 31:1 |

**Reporting cadence:**
- Weekly KPI dashboard delivered to stakeholders
- Bi-weekly steering committee review for progress analysis and strategy adjustments

## Post-Pilot Pathway

The pilot serves as the first step in a scalable **Land-and-Expand** partnership model:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Final Pilot Review">
    Comprehensive report detailing all KPI outcomes against initial objectives and success criteria.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Annual Contract Conversion">
    Based on pilot success. HANA has a proven **67% pilot-to-contract conversion rate**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scaled Deployment">
    Roll out to larger patient population with flexibility to add new clinical workflows and service modules in 60–90 day cycles.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What We Need to Scope a Pilot

To move quickly, we typically need:

- Target use case and protocol (PDF/Doc)
- Channel requirements (voice, SMS, WhatsApp)
- Integration points (EHR, CRM, scheduling)
- Language requirements
- Compliance constraints (data residency, governance)
- Definition of success (KPIs)
