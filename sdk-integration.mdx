## The Situation

The partner had built a strong product. Onboarding was smooth. The UX was clean. Clinicians liked it.

But after week one, engagement cratered. Patients opened the app once, maybe twice, then forgot about it. The engagement curve looked like a cliff.

The team tried everything: push notifications (ignored), gamification (gimmicky), more features (bloat). Nothing moved the needle.

The insight that changed their approach: their best outcomes came from patients who actually talked to care navigators. But they couldn't afford to call everyone.

## The Transformation

Rather than rebuild their product, the partner integrated HANA as an engagement layer via SDK.

HANA handles the conversations the app couldn't have: proactive check-ins, symptom collection, adherence follow-up, escalation to human navigators when needed.

The partner keeps their UX. Their clinical team keeps their workflows. HANA makes sure patients stay engaged between the moments they open the app.

Integration took 6 weeks. Engagement lifted 40% within 90 days.

## Before & After

| Metric | Before | After HANA |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Post-onboarding engagement | Cliff after week 1 | **Sustained engagement** |
| Outreach method | Push notifications (ignored) | **Conversational outreach (high response)** |
| Care navigator capacity | Couldn't scale | **AI handles routine, humans handle exceptions** |
| Clinical data between visits | Limited | **Continuous clinical data flow** |
| Form completion | Low (static) | **96%+ conversational completion** |

## Partner Business Impact

- **Engagement:** 40% lift in 90 days
- **Retention:** Improved D30 and D60 metrics
- **Operational:** Reduced care navigator load by 35%
- **Clinical:** Continuous data for outcomes measurement
