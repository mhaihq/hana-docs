# Features

## Multi-Channel Patient Communication

HANA meets patients where they are, supporting multiple communication channels:

| Channel | Use Case | Compliance |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **SMS** | Quick confirmations, scheduling, reminders | HIPAA-compliant |
| **Voice Calls** | Complex history-taking, detailed check-ins, assessments | HIPAA-compliant |
| **WhatsApp** | International patient populations, high-engagement markets | GDPR-compliant |
| **Telegram** | Eastern European and emerging market populations | GDPR-compliant |
| **iMessage** | US patient populations with Apple devices | HIPAA-compliant |

The reasoning engine determines the optimal channel for each patient based on their demonstrated preferences and response patterns.

## Voice AI Capabilities

- **Natural, conversational dialogue** — not robotic scripted responses
- **Multi-language support** — 3+ languages with proprietary healthcare-specific datasets
- **Configurable voice selection** — tone, speed, expressiveness, and style tunable per clinic
- **Adaptive branching** — conversations follow clinical protocols with dynamic follow-up based on patient responses
- **Transparency option** — some clinics intentionally choose a slightly less hyper-realistic voice so patients know they're speaking with AI

## Knowledge Base Integration (RAG)

Clinics provide their own content as the source of truth:

- PDFs of clinical protocols and guidelines
- Google Docs and text-based procedures
- Structured knowledge bases

HANA parses and indexes this content so agents retrieve the right information during conversations and stay aligned with approved clinical guidance.

<Tip>
  Text-based sources work best. Avoid image-only scans where possible for optimal parsing.
</Tip>

## Structured Operational Outputs

After every patient interaction, HANA produces actionable outputs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Task Lists" icon="list-check">
    What needs follow-up, with priority level and clinical context for why the task was created.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Call Summaries" icon="file-lines">
    Synthesized narrative summaries of what was discussed, what the patient reported, and what changed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flagged Issues" icon="flag">
    Risk signals, adherence concerns, and escalation triggers surfaced proactively for clinical review.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transcripts & Audio" icon="microphone">
    Full conversation records with optional audio playback for audit and clinical reference.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Agent Control Dashboard

For clinics that don't have an EHR or need a standalone view, HANA provides a **white-label dashboard** for managing agents:

- View all active patient conversations
- Review tasks, flags, and summaries
- Configure agent behavior and protocols
- Monitor engagement metrics in real-time
- Manage escalation workflows

## Feedback and Improvement Loop

HANA's implementation follows a rapid iteration cycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Brief / Protocol">
    Clinic provides the care protocol, workflow documentation, or simply describes their process on a call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent Draft">
    HANA builds an agent draft — typically mapping the workflow in Figma and configuring 2–3 test agents within 1–2 days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Environment">
    Clinic tests calls in a demo environment, interacting with agents as patients would.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feedback">
    Clinic provides feedback on conversation flow, tone, protocol accuracy, and patient experience.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iteration">
    HANA iterates on voice settings, prompts, and flow behavior. Agents can be rebuilt in a single day.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Patient Engagement Personalization

HANA learns patterns for each patient over time:

| Personalization Dimension | What HANA Learns |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Channel preference** | Voice vs. text vs. WhatsApp |
| **Optimal timing** | Best time and day of week for engagement |
| **Language complexity** | Simple vs. technical communication style |
| **Interaction style** | Short/direct vs. conversational |
| **Response cadence** | How quickly the patient typically responds |
| **Cultural context** | Language, cultural norms, communication expectations |

This is especially valuable for patients with repeated touchpoints over months — chronic care, behavioral health, rehabilitation, and palliative care.

## When HANA Is Not the Best Choice

HANA may be more than you need if:

- You only need a single, simple call flow with no follow-up
- You don't need operational tasking or flagging
- You're not in healthcare (and don't need healthcare-grade guardrails)
- Your existing infrastructure (e.g., Genesys + a voice provider) already covers all requirements

<Info>
  HANA is purpose-built for **continuous patient engagement between clinical encounters**. For pure call handling or front-desk automation, other solutions may be more appropriate.
