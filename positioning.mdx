# Competitive Positioning

## The Core Difference

Healthcare AI is crowded with solutions that handle **transactions** — booking, reminders, FAQs, call routing. HANA builds engagement infrastructure for **relationships** — continuous care, adaptation over time, and therapeutic alliance maintenance.

<Note>
  **The Problem We Solve:** Healthcare has endless monitoring tools. The problem is patients don't engage with them. HANA solves engagement between sessions — 85% weekly vs. the industry's 15–20%.
</Note>

## Market Positioning

HANA sits at the intersection of two axes that define the healthcare AI landscape:

**Vertical axis:** Application (single-purpose tool) → Infrastructure (platforms build on us)

**Horizontal axis:** Transactional (one-off interactions) → Relational (continuous engagement over time)

| Quadrant | Players | HANA's Position |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Application + Transactional | Puppeteer, Hello Patient (call handling, booking) | **Not our market** |
| Infrastructure + Transactional | Drips (horizontal, multi-industry) | **Adjacent, not competitive** |
| Application + Relational | — | **Gap in market** |
| **Infrastructure + Relational** | **HANA** | **We own this quadrant** |

## Feature Comparison

| Capability | Puppeteer | Hello Patient | Drips | HANA |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------|------|
| **Primary Use Case** | General voice agents | Front desk automation | Multi-industry engagement | Patient engagement between visits |
| **Transactional Calls** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |
| **Relational Engagement** | ❌ Limited | ❌ Limited | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Excellent |
| **Adapts to Patient Over Time** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Yes |
| **Clinical Protocols** | ⚠️ DIY | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ No | ✅ Built-in |
| **Multi-Language** | ❌ English | ❌ English | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ 3+ languages |
| **Multi-Country** | ❌ US-only | ❌ US-only | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ 5 countries |
| **Government Contracts** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ 2 active |
| **API-First / White-Label SDK** | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Yes |
| **Gross Margins** | ~40% | ~30% | Unknown | **75% → 85%** |
| **Weekly Engagement Rate** | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | **85%** |

## Use Case Positioning

| Use Case | Best Fit | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Front desk call answering | Hello Patient | Purpose-built for access/intake |
| Appointment booking/reminders | Puppeteer | General-purpose, easy to deploy |
| **Post-discharge monitoring** | **HANA** | Engagement-focused, adapts over time |
| **Chronic care management** | **HANA** | Relationship maintenance between visits |
| **Behavioral health check-ins** | **HANA** | Therapeutic alliance, protocol-based |
| **Medication adherence** | **HANA** | Continuous engagement, learns barriers |
| General healthcare conversations | Drips | Multi-industry, mature platform |

**HANA's sweet spot:** Anything requiring continuous patient engagement between clinical encounters.

## Technical Architecture Comparison

| Element | Competitors | HANA |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Voice Generation** | OpenAI/Anthropic APIs | Hybrid (foundation + proprietary) |
| **Conversation Logic** | Generic LLM prompting | Engagement reasoning model |
| **Adaptation** | Static protocols | Learns patient over time |
| **Clinical Knowledge** | General medical training | 1M+ conversation training |
| **Latency Optimization** | Real-time processing only | Pre-processing reasoning model |
| **Data Moat** | Foundation model data | Proprietary 1M+ interactions |

**The key difference:** HANA's two-model architecture (reasoning brain + speaking agent) enables clinical complexity that single-model competitors can't match.

## ROI Comparison

| Metric | Industry Baseline | HANA |
|--------|------------------|------|
| Patient Engagement Rate | 15–20% (apps) | **85%** |
| No-Show Rate | 23% average | **9%** (down from 23%) |
| Cost per Conversation | $3–5 (human) | **$0.50** (improving to $0.30–0.40) |
| Staff Time Saved | Baseline | **64% front desk reduction** |
| CCM/BHI Denial Rate | 15–20% | **3.2%** |
| Typical First-Year ROI | N/A | **15–30x** |

## Positioning by Audience

**For healthcare executives:** Healthcare has endless monitoring tools. The problem is patients don't engage with them. We solve engagement between sessions — 85% weekly vs. industry 15–20%.

**For platform partners:** Your users need engagement infrastructure. We provide it white-label in 3 weeks, saving you 18–24 months and millions in R&D.

**For "we'll build it ourselves":** Building engagement infrastructure takes 18–24 months and $2–4M. We've done it on $100K and 1M+ conversations. White-label our proven solution in weeks, or spend 2 years reinventing.
