# Pre-Operative & Post-Operative Care

## The Problem

Surgical care coordination is designed to fail. Multiple portals, faxed forms that disappear into queues, and phone tag that goes unanswered. Every surgery requires a small miracle of coordination — and when that miracle doesn't happen, OR slots worth $15,000+ are cancelled, patients who prepared emotionally and logistically are sent home, and surgeons walk into operating rooms not knowing if they'll actually operate.

Staff spend 60% of their time on administrative chase work rather than clinical exceptions.

## How HANA Solves It

### Pre-Operative Orchestration

HANA starts with what's already in the chart, then fills only the gaps:

- **Pull existing documentation** from the EHR
- **Identify what's missing** per procedure type
- **Run adaptive outreach** through the channel that works for each patient (voice for complex histories, SMS for confirmations)
- **Automatic escalation** when critical documents remain missing
- **Deliver complete pre-op packets 72 hours out** — not the day before

### Post-Operative Follow-Up

After discharge, HANA maintains contact to ensure recovery stays on track:

- "Did you complete your preparation routine for tomorrow?"
- "Are you taking your medications as prescribed?"
- "How is your pain level today?"
- "Are you doing your exercises correctly?"

Flagged concerns are routed to the clinical team for intervention before complications develop.

## Proven Results

| Metric | Before HANA | After HANA |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Documentation gathering | 4.2 days | **1.1 days** |
| Cases requiring staff phone chase | 42% | **8%** |
| Same-week cancellation rate | 8–12% | **< 3%** |
| Staff time on admin | 60% | **Clinical exceptions only** |
| Pre-op packet completeness | Day-before arrivals | **72 hours out** |

## Financial Impact

- **Avoided cancellation costs** — ~$15K per OR slot × 85% reduction in cancellations
- **Staff productivity** — 2.1 FTE equivalent time recovered annually
- **Surgeon satisfaction** — zero day-before documentation surprises in pilot
