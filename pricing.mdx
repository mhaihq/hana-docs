# Pricing

HANA's pricing is designed around a single principle: **outcomes, not software seats**.

## Pricing Model

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Base Model** | Per-Patient-Per-Month (PMPM) |
| **Range** | $3–4 PMPM |
| **Structure** | Platform fee + usage-based |
| **Pilot Pricing** | Starting at €5K for 100 patients / 30 days |

## Why PMPM

The Per-Patient-Per-Month model aligns with how healthcare already thinks about costs and is the industry-standard pricing structure for health technology platforms:

- **For fee-for-service providers:** HANA reduces no-shows and increases encounters — paying for itself through recovered revenue
- **For value-based care providers:** HANA improves adherence, reduces readmissions, and hits quality metrics — driving shared savings
- **For care program enrollment (CCM/BHI/PCM):** HANA enables programs that generate $60–150/patient/month in reimbursement, making the $3–4 PMPM cost negligible

## Outcome-Based Value

| Outcome | How HANA Delivers |
|---------|-------------------|
| **No-show recovery** | AI recovers missed appointments at 80% less than the cost of the no-show |
| **Care program revenue** | Enable CCM/BHI/PCM enrollment that adds $60–150/patient/month in reimbursement |
| **Staff time recovery** | 3.5 hours saved per intake, 60% reduction in admin follow-up |
| **Avoided cancellations** | ~$15K per OR slot saved through pre-op orchestration |
| **Reduced ER visits** | Early intervention on adherence and side effects prevents costly escalations |

## Pilot Guarantee

HANA offers outcome-based pilot guarantees:

<Note>
  **"Cut no-shows 50% or don't pay."** — Pilots are designed to prove value before commitment.
