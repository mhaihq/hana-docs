# Medication Adherence

## The Problem

The standard solution — more reminder texts — doesn't work. Patients have trained themselves to ignore anything that looks automated. "Did you take your medication? Y/N" generates no insight and no engagement.

The real problem isn't that patients forget. It's that clinics have no way to have individual conversations about what's actually going wrong — cost, side effects, confusion, feeling better, or simply giving up.

## How HANA Solves It

HANA replaces generic reminders with conversational check-ins that ask the questions staff would ask — at scale.

Instead of "Did you take your medication?" the system asks open-ended questions:

- "How are you feeling on this medication?"
- "Any trouble getting your refill?"
- "Anything making it hard to take it as prescribed?"

The responses aren't transcripts dumped into a chart. They're **structured barrier reports**: 47 patients reporting cost issues. 23 with side effects. 12 who stopped because they felt better.

Clinicians see patterns. They intervene where it matters. They do it before patients end up in the ER.

## Adaptive Frequency

The reasoning engine adjusts monitoring based on patient behavior:

- **Adherent patients** — weekly check-in maintained, conversation kept light
- **Declining adherence detected** — frequency increases to 2–3x/week
- **Barrier identified** — follow-up conversation specifically addresses the reported issue
- **Side effect flagged** — clinical team alerted within 48 hours

## Proven Results

| Metric | Before HANA | After HANA |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Medication adherence | 30% | **73%** (2.4x improvement) |
| Visibility into barriers | None | **Structured reports by category** |
| Patient engagement | Generic texts (low response) | **85% weekly engagement** |
| Side effect discovery | At appointments | **Flagged within 48 hours** |
| Care model | Reactive (after crisis) | **Proactive intervention on trends** |

## Clinical & Financial Outcomes

- **Avoided hospitalizations** — early intervention on 23% of at-risk patients
- **Clinician time saved** — barrier reports vs. chart review = 12 minutes saved per patient/month
- **Patient experience** — 85% weekly engagement vs. 15–20% industry benchmark
