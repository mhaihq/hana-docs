## The Situation

The clinic knew its patients weren't taking their medications. The data was clear: 30% adherence. But the data couldn't tell them *why*.

Were patients forgetting? Could they not afford refills? Were side effects intolerable? Did they stop because they felt better?

The standard solution — more reminder texts — wasn't working. Patients had trained themselves to ignore anything automated. And the clinical team couldn't call everyone. The clinic had no way to have 2,800 individual conversations about what was actually going wrong.

## The Transformation

HANA runs conversational check-ins that ask the questions staff would ask — but at scale.

Instead of "Did you take your medication?" (yes/no checkbox), the system asks open-ended questions: "How are you feeling on this medication?" "Any trouble getting your refill?" "Anything making it hard to take it as prescribed?"

The responses are structured barrier reports: 47 patients reporting cost issues. 23 with side effects. 12 who stopped because they felt better.

Clinicians see patterns. They intervene where it matters. They do it before patients end up in the ER.

## Before & After

| Metric | Before | After HANA |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Medication adherence | ~30% | **73%** |
| Visibility into adherence barriers | None | **Structured barrier reports** |
| Patient engagement method | Generic texts (low response) | **Conversational check-ins (85%)** |
| Care model | Reactive (after crisis) | **Proactive intervention on trends** |
| Side effect discovery | At appointments | **Flagged within 48 hours** |

## Clinical & Financial Outcomes

- **Adherence improvement:** 2.4x (30% → 73%)
- **Avoided hospitalizations:** Early intervention on 23% of at-risk patients
- **Clinician time:** Barrier reports vs. chart review = 12 min saved per patient/month
- **Patient experience:** 85% weekly engagement vs. 15–20% industry benchmark
