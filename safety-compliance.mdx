# Safety & Compliance

HANA is built with clinical safety as a core architectural feature — not an afterthought bolted onto a general-purpose AI system. The platform has managed over **1 million patient interactions with zero critical adverse events**.

## Safety Architecture

### Human-in-the-Loop Design

HANA operates with a "Human-in-the-Loop" safety architecture at every level:

- **NLP classifiers** actively monitor all conversations for semantic markers of acute risk (self-harm, suicidality, medical emergency)
- **Detection triggers immediate fail-safe protocols** — suspending the AI workflow and routing the case to on-call clinical staff
- **Every clinical output** is expressly intended to complement, not replace, the final assessment of the consulting clinician

### Clinic-Defined Escalation Protocols

HANA does not impose a one-size-fits-all safety protocol. Instead, escalation procedures are defined collaboratively with each clinic during implementation:

| Scenario | Example Clinic Response A | Example Clinic Response B |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Suicidality detected | Interrupt call, direct patient to emergency services | Interrupt call + send SMS to on-call clinician + connect to 24/7 support line |
| Medication crisis | Flag for next-day clinical review | Immediate escalation to prescribing physician |
| Missed critical appointments | Automated re-engagement sequence | Alert care coordinator for manual outreach |

<Warning>
  HANA is not a crisis hotline. It does not counsel patients in emergencies. The system is built to **detect and route appropriately** based on each clinic's agreed procedures.
</Warning>

### Tiered Safety Monitoring

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Real-time NLP classifiers** | Monitor every utterance for risk markers during conversation |
| **Post-call safety audit** | Secondary review of completed conversations for missed signals |
| **Interaction scoring** | Every interaction scored for safety, relevance, and clinical accuracy |
| **Clinical review queue** | Flagged interactions surfaced for human clinician review |

## Regulatory Compliance

### HIPAA (United States)

- All patient-facing communications use **HIPAA-compliant channels**
- SMS communications through secure, compliant gateways
- **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** executed with all clinical partners
- Full audit trail for every patient interaction

### GDPR (European Union)

- **Data sovereignty** — patient data processed within region-locked EU infrastructure
- Cross-border data transfer strictly prohibited
- GDPR-compliant consent and data handling procedures
- Right to erasure and data portability supported

### Data Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Encryption at rest** | AES-256 |
| **Encryption in transit** | TLS 1.3 |
| **Data residency** | Region-locked cloud infrastructure (EU for EU, US for US) |
| **Anonymization** | Cryptographic hashing for research and analysis datasets |
| **Access controls** | Role-based access with audit logging |

### Country-Specific Compliance

HANA ensures compliance with local regulations across all operating jurisdictions. The platform currently operates in compliance with regulatory frameworks in:

- United States (HIPAA)
- European Union (GDPR)
- United Kingdom (UK GDPR)
- Ireland (HSE data governance standards)
- Italy (regional health data regulations)

## On-Premise Deployment

For organizations with the strictest data residency requirements:

- Full HANA platform installed on the organization's own servers
- **Zero external data transmission** — all processing happens within the facility
- Licensing-based model
- Currently deployed/testing with hospital systems in Italy and Middle East sovereign cloud environments

## Consent and Transparency

- Patients are informed they are interacting with an AI system
- Explicit consent obtained for clinical care and service improvement during standard intake procedures
- Some clinics choose voice settings that make the AI nature of the interaction clearly apparent
- Full audit trail available for regulatory review

<Info>
  HANA's safety architecture is not "just a prompt." It's a dedicated, multi-layer system designed for the reality that healthcare conversations can surface life-threatening situations — and the response must be immediate, appropriate, and clinic-defined.
