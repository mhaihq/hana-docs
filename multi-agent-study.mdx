## Abstract

Healthcare systems face a dual crisis: patient disengagement and unsustainable administrative burden on clinicians. This quality improvement study examined the impact of shifting from passive digital intake forms to HANA's dynamic, multi-agent conversational framework.

The study analyzed engagement data from 1,012 patients across a multinational user base. In Phase 1, patients completed standard digital intake forms with EHR-generated reminders. In Phase 2 (approximately one week later), patients transitioned to HANA's conversational flow using SMS scheduling and voice-based intake calls.

**Key findings:**

- Session completion rate improved from 68.3% to **84.1%** (+15.8 pts)
- Median time-to-complete reduced from 54.2 hours to **14.5 hours** (-73.2%)
- Average response length increased from 45 words to **315 words** per intake (+7x)
- SDOH markers captured increased from 0.4 to **3.2 per patient** (+8x)
- Clinical reviewers rated HANA summaries **4.1/5.0** vs. 3.2/5.0 for baseline
- **93% of clinicians** preferred HANA-generated reports for comprehensiveness

## Study Context

The study addressed two well-documented challenges:

1. **Patient disengagement** — 50% of chronic patients don't take medications as prescribed, contributing to $100B–$289B in avoidable costs annually
2. **Administrative burden** — Clinicians spend nearly 2 hours on EHR/desk work for every 1 hour of direct patient care

Recent research (JAMA Internal Medicine, Nature Medicine, Frontiers in Digital Health) demonstrates that AI-driven conversational tools can exhibit higher perceived empathy than time-constrained humans and improve medication adherence through 24/7 responsiveness.

## The HANA System

HANA operates as a dual-agent architecture:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Reasoning Model** | Analyzes existing patient data pre-call to determine optimal questions and approach |
| **Conversational Model** | Handles real-time, low-latency dialogue with patients |
| **Data Science Agent** | Identifies missing data from Phase 1 intake |
| **Health Coach Agent** | Guides conversation while minimizing redundant queries |
| **Domain Expert Agent** | Synthesizes all data into clinically-rich pre-assessment summaries |
